# FeedForward Models

Implementation of an exponential and an auto-regressive feedforward model to solve a slightly modified version of the OpenAI inverted pendulum environment. These algorithms cannot fully solve the inverted pedulum tak due to the lack of feedback, although they still learn to swing the pendulm upward.
